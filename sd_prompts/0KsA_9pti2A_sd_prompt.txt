A photorealistic dangerous scene description:
A man is riding a brown horse on a dirt road, holding the reins tightly in his hands. The horse is galloping quickly down the road, its front hooves lifted off the ground. The man's expression is focused and determined as he guides the horse forward. However, as they round a bend in the road, the horse suddenly loses its footing and begins to slip on the wet surface. The man struggles to maintain his balance, his face turning pale with fear as he braces himself for impact. In the distance, a car can be seen skidding to a stop as the horse and rider tumble off the road.
