Title: Helicopter Crash
A photorealistic scene of a helicopter crashing in a city street. The helicopter is in the middle of the frame, with its tail end facing upwards and the rotors spinning wildly. The pilot can be seen inside the cockpit, frantically trying to control the aircraft. The street below is filled with people and cars, who are all running away in terror. The helicopter is in mid-air, just moments away from crashing into the ground. Sparks can be seen flying from the rotors, and the helicopter is surrounded by a cloud of dust and debris. The scene is chaotic and terrifying, with the potential for serious injury or even death.
