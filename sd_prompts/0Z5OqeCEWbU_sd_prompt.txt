A photorealistic dangerous scene description of a goat running at full speed on a dirt road, its hooves skidding on the loose surface, sparks flying from its front hooves. The goat appears to be in a state of panic, its eyes wide and focused on something ahead. The air is filled with dust and debris from the goat's movements, and the overall atmosphere is one of intense energy and motion.
